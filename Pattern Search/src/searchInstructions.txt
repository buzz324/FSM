// Example input: aabbaab
// Start off with a dummy 'start state' which can be connected once we are sure of all the alternations etc...
// We need to have: 
// - The current state that we're in (curr)
// - A list of possible next states (next)
// - A 'mark' which indicates where we started
// - A 'pointer' which indicates where we are at the moment.

// Sequence of operations: 
// Put the start state onto the current state. 
// Put the possible next states of start into next state array.
// If it's a branching state, just copy the next states into the current states
// Check and match with all of the current states.
// If it matches, get the matching state's next states,
