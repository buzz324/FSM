// Example input: aabbaab
// Start off with a dummy 'start state' which can be connected once we are sure of all the alternations etc...
// We need to have: 
// - A list of current possible states we can be in (curr)
// - A list of possible next states (next)

// Sequence of operations: 
// Put the dummy start state (0) in curr
// We're not actually 'in' a branching state, it just tells us there are two possible current states we can be in.
// So pop off 0 from curr and pop in 1
// Now that we're on 1, check if we're looking at an A
// Since we are, then pass onto state 4. Put state 4 into next. 
// 

// Enter the branching start state
// 
// Pop off all options and check if they match
